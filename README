PUTRAMA
========

This is a small script that will use one of the german public transport server (VRR/EFA) to
compute the travel time from a whole map to a given destination point. 

The name is an abbreviation for PUblich TRAnsport MAp.

Putrama is a Linux perl script and builds heavily on WWW::EFA and Travel::Routing::DE::VRR.
(Actually i somehow had to use both, because of compile errors, might be my Ubuntu beta?)
Furthermore it uses certain libraries like XML, GD..

Note that Putrama uses at least sed to modify the file written by Geo::KML::Polymap,
unluckily the module does not allow for parameters.

Putrama will produce a .KML file, you can easily load with Google Earth for viewing purposes.

Putrama was programmed on the first INI-hackatron (http://www.ini.rub.de), 21th october 2014.

Source code can be found under https://github.com/aydindemircioglu/putrama,
the website with an example map is at http://aydindemircioglu.github.io/putrama.

Usage
-------

$ ./putrama.pl [options]

There are many options, some are from the Travel::Routing::DE package, some are new.
Those that can be reasonably used are the following:

	--arrive HH:MM
		arrival time, e.g. 10:00 in the morning to get in time to the morning lectures.
	--colorbins #
		number of bins to threshold the final connection times. Defaults to 32 (if enough tiles are queried).
	--date DD.MM.YYYY
		date when to query the connections. weekdays should be faster than weekends,
		day connections faster than night connections.
	--endcolor AABBGGRR
		color for slow connections, alpha value, blue value, green value, red value in hexadecimal.
	--endlat #
		end latitute of grid.
	--endlong #
		end longitute of grid.
	--gridsizelat #
		how many tiles in latitute direction should be created?
	--gridsizelong #
		how many tiles in longitude direction should be created?
	--kmlfilename filename
		filename for kml output
	--startcolor AABBGGRR
		color for fast connections, alpha value, blue value, green value, red value in hexadecimal.
	--startlat #
		start latitute of grid.
	--startlong=f
		start longitute of grid.
	--to city, stop 
		specify where the connections should go to. 
	--verbosity #
		verbosity level, 0 = few outputs, 100 = all outputs.

The map on this website was created with 
$ ./putrama.pl --gridsizelong 64 --gridsizelat 64 --startlat 51.340 -endlat 51.750  --startlong 7 --endlong 7.5 --date 6.11.2014 --verbosity 100
